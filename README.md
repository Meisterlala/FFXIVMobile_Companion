# FFXIVM (FFXIV Mobile) Companion
### This works on android devices (no root required) and Mumu/Bluestacks emulators

## Prerequisites
- A computer
- [Download the exe file here](http://aida.moe/ffxiv_mobile/FFXIVMobile_Companion.exe)

 ### One of the following:
* Your phone connected to the same network as your computer (it's fine for your computer to be wired and your phone wifi)
* Your phone connected to the computer via USB
* Mumu (Rooted, enable root by going to Settings -> Other -> Enable "Root Permissions" and restarting Mumu)
* Bluestacks (Rooted, [you can learn how to root it here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVk5vq_0vkE>))

Make sure you've enabled ADB in Bluestacks too (Settings -> Advanced -> turn on Android Debug Bridge)

## Before You Start
- If you do not have the game installed, you can download and install it through this program
- If you have the game installed but not patched, you can patch it through this program to change languages to whatever you want
- If you want to update your translations or fix issues with the game, this program will do that too

A reminder that you should **never** install or open WeChat on your emulator, you *will* get banned. Install WeChat on your actual phone and then scan the QR code on your emulator to log in.

## Usage

1. Go to where you downloaded the file and open it (if you get a warning from Windows Smartscreen select "Run anyway")
2. Follow the directions on the window that opens

It's that easy!

## Known Issues

* Potions are no longer usable via the quick item bag
* Some translations are wrong (Why is "track quest" translated as "Fiendish Orbs"??), missing (skill descriptions), or just plain weird (Not every NPC is Kan--e--senna game, please). We cannot modify the english translation and therefore cannot fix these. Sorry!

## Having issues?

Make sure to read all directions carefully. If you still can't get it to work, you can [join our discord](http://discord.gg/ffxivmobile) to get help.
